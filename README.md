# msys2-downloader

# DEPRECATED. Use [msys2dl](https://github.com/nanoufo/msys2dl) instead.


This tool is designed for downloading, extracting MSYS2 packages and converting them to Debian packages for use in cross-compiling. While you won't be able to run executable files, you'll have access to includes and libraries to link against. 

## How to install

Option 1 (recommended): pipx creates a virtual environment for the installed application, ensuring that the application and its dependencies do not conflict with system Python packages.

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/nanoufo/msys2-downloader.git@main
```

Option 2:

```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/nanoufo/msys2-downloader.git@main
```

## How to use

Conversion to Debian packages.

Note: Use this feature only with `mingw64` or `mingw32` environments. Files in packages from these environments are relocated from `/mingw{32,64}` to `/usr/{i686,x86_64}-w64-mingw32`, where distribution-provided tools expect them to be. Paths in .pc (pkg-config) files are also modified.

Note: Dependencies are downloaded by default. Use the `--no-deps` flag to opt-out..
 
```bash
$ msys2-download --make-deb --output /tmp/deb --env mingw64 wxwidgets3.2-msw

## Options

### Basic
| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--env ENV`                     | Optional. Specifies the MSYS2 environment to search for packages. Choose from `clangarm64`, `clang32`, `clang64`, `mingw32`, `mingw64`, `ucrt64`. This option enables the use of short package names like `curl` instead of `mingw-w64-x86_64-curl`. |
| `--extract`                     | **Extraction mode.** Unpack the contents of packages to the output directory.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `--make-deb`                    | **Build .deb mode.** Convert MSYS2 packages to Debian packages. For `mingw32` and `mingw64`, files are relocated from `/mingw{32,64}` to `/usr/{i686,x86_64}-w64-mingw32`.                                                                            |
| `--no-deps`                     | Download only the specified packages without their dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `--output PATH`                 | Optional. Debian packages generated or extracted files will be located in this directory. By default, the current directory will be used.                                                                                                          |
| `--exclude PACKAGE [PACKAGE ...]`| Optional. Ignores these packages. When resolving dependencies, excluded packages' dependencies are excluded as well. Useful if you want to bypass libraries installed from other sources.                                                |

To combine `--exclude` with the list of included packages, use the following syntax:
```bash
$ msys2-download --exclude zlib -- curl 
```

### Advanced
| Option                           | Description                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--base-url URL`                  | Specifies the URL to download packages from. The default is `https://mirror.msys2.org`.                      |
| `--cache-dir PATH`                | Specifies the directory where packages are downloaded. The default directory is `~/.cache/msys2-downloader`. |
